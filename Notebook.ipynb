    "# Bundling Ecosystem Services at a High Resolution: a brief guide\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook describes the steps in modelling ecosystem services at a 2 m resolution in the combined built-up areas of three large UK towns: Milton Keynes, Bedord and Luton. Three steps are included in identifying ecosystem service bundles and ES trade-offs and synergies, and Bayesian Belief Networks were used to assess whether landscape configuration and landscape connectivity affect ES trade-offs and synergies in urban areas.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. In step 1, six ecosystem services were modelled using the InVEST modelling framework. The six ecosystem services were Habitat quality, Nutrient retention, Pollination, Carbon storage, Potential soil erosion and Water supply. K-means clustering and Principal Component Analysis were conducted to determine the bundles and identify the spatial trade-offs and synergies of the considered ecosystem services.\n",

    "2. In step 2, a Bayesian Belief Network modelling approach was used to test whether landscape configuration could drive ecosystem service trade-offs and synergies. \n",

The results of this study show that ecosystem service bundle analysis can be used to identify the existence of synergies and trade-offs. This could be used in sustainable ecosystem management and urban planning to improve the provision of multiple ecosystem services in urban areas and in green space design. However, the spatial distribution of the bundles are sensitive to the ecosystem services selected and care should be taken to select model data appropriate to the scale of inquiry. "
